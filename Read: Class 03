## Ordered and Unordered Lists

***An unordered list should be used when you want to specify other items under a main item. You can change the bullet style by typing in the "list-style-type" and the type of bullet you want.You should use an ordered list for a "top 10" like list that requires organization from top to bottom. You can change the number by putting "type="i"" in the "ol" element. Another option will be using the "start=""" tag in the ol element. ***

## Box Model

***Margin is used to push elements like text and numbers away from a box while padding moves elements away from the boxes border. The "ul" element allows for your items to be listed in no order. The "ol" elements orders your items in a fashion from top to bottom. The "li" elements lists all of your items within the array. The "span" element addresses unordered items in your list.***

## Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

***String, numbers and objects can be stored in an array. Yes the "people" array is valid and you can access the values with "console.log" with a number in parentheses i.e. "0". ***
